The start in Milngavie is easily reached by a short train ride from Glasgow's city center, which has a major international airport (GLA) and excellent rail connections. The terminus in Fort William is also well-serviced by train and bus, with connections back to Glasgow and other parts of the UK. The trail's popularity has given rise to a robust baggage transfer industry, allowing many hikers to walk each day with only a light daypack.
